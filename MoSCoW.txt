* Summary
Our goal for the custom project is to create a tower defense game in the typical style of that genre: A round/wave begins with the user being able to select a number of towers and place them onto the map. By the final version, we hope to have multiple different types of towers with different abilities.

The user will have some sort of coin/credit system, earned for completing levels, that restrict their ability to acquire towers. Then the user will select “start”, and a deterministic sequence of enemies will appear moving along a predetermined path. The towers will do damage to the enemies in accordance with their abilities. Any enemies that make it through all the user’s defenses will deal damage to the end point, eventually defeating it (player loses).

If the user’s defenses destroy all enemies before the end point is destroyed, the player “survives the wave” and receives reward points for future rounds. The map will remain unchanged between waves, with the player’s towers remaining in place for subsequent waves. The waves will get progressively more difficult, with stronger and more numerous enemies.
