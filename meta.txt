-- Describe your approach to implementing the lab.
Matin - Completely revamped how we organized levels and UI, making everything use the GameObject and Level architecture
and allow for reusable components across both games. This change allowed us to easily and modularly add buttons, UI elements,
and gameObjects in both the games and the editor. After the breakout game worked with the new design, others helped transfering
it into other deliverables of the project. I then helped each team member with bug fixes.

Marcin - Mostly worked on porting over the GraveRunner functionality into the new infrastructure after Matin did the initial setup.
This included both the game itself and its level editor.

Zack - 
(Milestone 1) Rewrote all UI components to be game objects, including buttons, menus, etc. Worked extensively
on game editors front-end to match rest of the component based architecture. 
(Milestone 2) Did initial custom game setup getting a working game going from scratch, 
reconfigured the menus to new game, added UI elements to the in-game experience, and worked on grid components for object placement like mouse over of 
items when clicked.

Roshan - 
(Milestone 1): 
Rewrote level file design, generation and updation via level editor. Added Instructions menus. 
Dynamic selection of block textures from the resources. Wrote backend for the level editor.
(Milestone 2):
Added Enemy Path file so that we can have pre defined paths as well.
Added Enemy tower path to have layers levels.
Built full Level editor.
Built 4 levels. Wrote Enemy spawner and enemy spawner file with config data on what to spawn.
Updated instructions.
